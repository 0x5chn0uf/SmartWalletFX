# Template Scripts (Expert)

This directory contains reusable template scripts for common testing scenarios:

- `api_test_template.py`: Function-based template for API tests with configurable fixtures
- `database_test_template.py`: Template for database tests including setup and teardown patterns
- `integration_test_template.py`: Template for integration tests with workflow scaffolding

Use these templates as starting points for writing new tests quickly and consistently. Customize configuration objects as needed.
