# API Examples (Intermediate)

This directory contains examples for testing API endpoints using the fixture system:

- `endpoint_example.py`: Testing a FastAPI endpoint with `client` or `async_client`
- `auth_patterns.py`: Authentication scenarios including token validation and error cases
- `mock_service_example.py`: Testing API calls with external services mocked via `mock_external_apis`

Each example demonstrates common patterns for endpoint testing, error handling, and fixture composition.
