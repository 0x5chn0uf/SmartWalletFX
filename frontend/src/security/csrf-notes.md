# CSRF Protection Notes

## Current Implementation

With the move to httpOnly cookies for authentication, the application now has inherent CSRF protection through the browser's SameSite cookie attribute, which is set to "lax" in the backend.

## Security Measures in Place

1. **SameSite=lax**: Cookies are only sent on same-site requests and top-level navigation
2. **HttpOnly**: Tokens cannot be accessed via JavaScript, preventing XSS attacks
3. **Secure**: Cookies should only be sent over HTTPS in production (configured in backend)
4. **withCredentials**: Ensures cookies are sent with cross-origin requests when needed

## Additional Considerations

For enhanced CSRF protection in production, consider:

1. **Double Submit Cookie Pattern**: Add a CSRF token in both a cookie and request header
2. **Origin Header Validation**: Backend should validate the Origin header
3. **SameSite=strict**: For applications that don't need cross-site functionality
4. **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers to prevent XSS

## Current Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: SameSite=lax provides good protection for most CSRF scenarios
- **Cookie-based auth** eliminates the main XSS vector (localStorage token theft)
- **Backend validation** ensures tokens are properly validated

The current implementation provides a good baseline security posture that significantly improves upon the previous localStorage approach.
