## üöÄ Quickstart with Docker Compose

The fastest way to spin up the **entire** SmartWalletFX stack (backend, frontend, PostgreSQL & Redis) is via Docker Compose:

```bash
# 1. Clone & enter the repo
 git clone https://github.com/0x5chn0uf/smartwalletfx.git
 cd smartwalletfx

# 2. Copy environment variables (edit if you need to)
 cp .env.example .env

# 3. Launch the stack ‚Äì one command üî•
 ./scripts/start.sh           # builds images & starts containers in the background

# Tail logs (optional)
 STACK_LOGS=1 ./scripts/start.sh
```

When the health-checks pass you'll have:

| Service  | URL                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000            |
| Backend  | http://localhost:8000/docs       |
| Postgres | localhost:5432 (devuser/devpass) |
| Redis    | localhost:6379                   |

Stop the stack at any time:

```bash
./scripts/stop.sh        # stop containers, keep DB volume
PURGE=1 ./scripts/stop.sh  # also remove volumes for a clean slate
```

> **Tip:** The Compose file mounts your source code, so changes to the backend or frontend hot-reload automatically.

### One-liner Dev Setup (hot-reload)

Want code-reload on every save? Use the Makefile helper which spawns Postgres & Redis via Docker **once** then starts the backend & frontend in watch-mode:

```bash
make start      # or ./scripts/start_dev.sh
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and start hacking ‚Äì any change in `backend/` or `frontend/` will instantly reload.
